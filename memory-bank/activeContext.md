# Active Context

## Current Focus: Trek Section Banner Integration

### Recent Changes (Latest Session)

#### 1. Integrated Banner Management into Trek Section System
- **Problem**: User wanted to manage banners directly from the trek section dashboard, allowing mixed ordering of trek sections and banner sections
- **Solution**: Extended the existing TrekSection model and system to support both trek sections and banner sections with a unified interface
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/models/TrekSection.js` - Added type field and banner-specific fields (bannerImage, overlayText, overlayColor, textColor, linkToTrek, couponCode, discountPercentage, mobileOptimized)
  - `backend/controllers/trekSectionController.js` - Updated to handle both trek and banner section types with proper validation
  - `frontend/src/components/TrekSectionManager.js` - Enhanced with type selector and conditional form fields for banner configuration
  - `frontend/src/components/TrekBannerSection.js` - New component for displaying banner sections with mobile-responsive design
  - `frontend/src/components/HomeTrekSections.js` - Updated to render both trek sections and banner sections based on type
- **Features Added**:

  - Coupon code and discount percentage support
  - Mobile optimization toggle
  - Link to specific trek detail pages
  - Unified ordering system for mixed content

#### 2. Previous: Partial Payment Feature Implementation

- **Problem**: Native select elements have compatibility issues on iOS devices in the enquiry form and support ticket creation
- **Solution**: Created a custom dropdown component that works properly on all devices including iOS
- **Files Created/Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/components/CustomDropdown.js` - New custom dropdown component with full iOS compatibility

#### 2. Fixed Trek Update Issue
- **Problem**: Partial payment settings were not being saved when editing a trek
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/controllers/trekController.js` to extract and handle `partialPayment` field in the `updateTrek` function
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `backend/controllers/trekController.js` - Added `partialPayment` to destructured fields and `updateData` object

#### 2. Fixed Route Conflict Issue
- **Problem**: `/check-pending` route was being caught by `/:id` route, causing "Cast to ObjectId failed" error
- **Solution**: Moved `/check-pending` route before `/:id` route in `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Reordered routes to fix conflict

#### 3. Added Delete Pending Booking Feature

- **Solution**: Implemented complete delete pending booking functionality
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Added `deletePendingBooking` function
  - `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Added `DELETE /pending/:bookingId` route
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added `deletePendingBooking` API function
  - `frontend/src/pages/BookingPage.js` - Added modal with options to continue or delete existing booking

#### 4. Added Partial Payment Actions for Admin
- **Problem**: Admin booking tables and trek performance pages didn't show specific actions for partial payment bookings
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive partial payment management actions for admins
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Added `sendPartialPaymentReminder` and `markPartialPaymentComplete` functions

#### 5. Enhanced Invoice Generation for Partial Payments
- **Problem**: Invoices didn't reflect partial payment status and payment breakdown
- **Solution**: Updated invoice generator to include comprehensive partial payment information
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/utils/invoiceGenerator.js` - Enhanced to show partial payment breakdown, remaining balance, due dates, and payment status

#### 6. Fixed Revenue Calculation and Display for Partial Payments
- **Problem**: Revenue was calculated using total booking amount instead of actual amount paid for partial payments
- **Solution**: Updated revenue calculation and display to show correct amounts for partial payments
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/trekController.js` - Updated `getBatchPerformance` and `getTrekPerformance` to calculate revenue based on actual amount paid for partial payments
  - `frontend/src/pages/TrekPerformance.js` - Updated booking table to show amount paid, remaining balance, and due dates for partial payments
  - `frontend/src/components/ViewBookingModal.js` - Enhanced to show comprehensive partial payment information including payment mode, initial payment, remaining balance, and due dates

#### 7. Enhanced Booking Details Page for Partial Payments
- **Problem**: Booking details page didn't show partial payment information like remaining balance and due date
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive partial payment information display in the booking details page
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/pages/BookingDetail.js` - Added partial payment section showing payment mode, amount paid, remaining balance, due date, and final payment date
  - Added prominent Payment Summary section with large display of remaining due amount and "Pay Remaining Balance" button
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Fixed `getBookingById` to include `paymentMode` and `partialPaymentDetails` fields in response

#### 8. Added Phone Number Update from Booking Input
- **Problem**: When users create bookings, if they don't have a phone number in their profile, the system doesn't update it from the booking form input
- **Solution**: Added logic to automatically update user's phone number from booking input if they don't have one
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Added phone number update logic in both `createBooking` and `createCustomTrekBooking` functions
  - The system now checks if the user has a phone number, and if not, updates it from the `userDetails.phone` in the booking input
  - Added error handling to ensure booking creation doesn't fail if phone number update fails

- **Pending Booking Management**: Users can now check, continue, or delete existing pending bookings
- **Security**: Delete pending booking only works for the booking owner and only for pending_payment status
