## Current Focus: Manual Booking System Implementation

### Recent Changes (Latest Session)

#### 1. Implemented Manual Booking System for Admin Panel
- **Problem**: Admins needed the ability to manually create bookings on behalf of users and participants
- **Solution**: Built a comprehensive manual booking system with step-by-step flow
- **Files Modified/Created**:
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Added manual booking functions (validateUserByPhone, createUserForManualBooking, createManualBooking)
  - `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Added manual booking routes (/manual/validate-user, /manual/create-user, /manual/create-booking)
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added manual booking API functions
  - `frontend/src/components/ManualBookingModal.js` - New component for step-by-step manual booking flow
  - `frontend/src/pages/AdminBookings.js` - Added "Create Manual Booking" button and modal integration

#### 2. Manual Booking Features Implemented:
- **Step 1: Phone Validation**: Enter phone number to check if user exists
- **Step 2: User Creation**: If user doesn't exist, create new user with required details
- **Step 3: Booking Creation**: Select trek/batch, enter participant details, set payment status
- **Payment Status Options**: Payment Completed, Partial Payment, Unpaid
- **Admin Tag**: All manual bookings are tagged with "Admin Created" in admin remarks
- **User Management**: Automatic user creation with temporary password and verified status

#### 3. Previous: Trek Section Banner Integration

#### 1. Integrated Banner Management into Trek Section System

  - `frontend/src/components/TrekSectionManager.js` - Enhanced with type selector and conditional form fields for banner configuration
  - `frontend/src/components/TrekBannerSection.js` - New component for displaying banner sections with mobile-responsive design
  - `frontend/src/components/HomeTrekSections.js` - Updated to render both trek sections and banner sections based on type
- **Features Added**:
  - Type selector (Trek Section vs Banner Section) in the admin interface
