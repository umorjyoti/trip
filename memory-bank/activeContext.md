## Current Focus: Streamlined Manual Booking System Implementation

### Recent Changes (Latest Session)

#### 1. Reworked Manual Booking Process for Streamlined Flow
- **Problem**: The manual booking process was overly complex with multiple useEffect hooks and complex state management
- **Solution**: Completely reworked the manual booking system to follow the exact same pattern as normal bookings with a clean, streamlined flow
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/components/ManualBookingModal.js` - Completely reworked with simplified state management and streamlined flow

#### 2. Manual Booking Flow Improvements:
- **Step 1: User Lookup & Creation**: 
  - Search for user by phone number
  - If found: fetch existing user details and proceed to booking
  - If not found: create new user with `adminCreated: true` flag
- **Step 2: User Creation** (if needed):
  - Simplified form with required fields (name, email, phone)
  - Optional fields (address, city, state, zipCode, country)
  - Automatic user creation with verified status and adminCreated flag
- **Step 3: Booking Flow** (exactly like normal bookings):
  - Trek selection from enabled treks
  - Batch selection with availability checking
  - Participant details management
  - Emergency contact (optional)
  - Payment status selection according to DB enums
- **Payment Status Options**: 
  - `payment_completed` - Full payment received
  - `payment_confirmed_partial` - Partial payment received
  - `unpaid` - No payment received

#### 3. Previous: Trek Section Banner Integration

#### 1. Integrated Banner Management into Trek Section System
- **Problem**: User wanted to manage banners directly from the trek section dashboard, allowing mixed ordering of trek sections and banner sections
- **Solution**: Extended the existing TrekSection model and system to support both trek sections and banner sections with a unified interface
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/models/TrekSection.js` - Added type field and banner-specific fields (bannerImage, overlayText, overlayColor, textColor, linkToTrek, couponCode, discountPercentage, mobileOptimized)
  - `backend/controllers/trekSectionController.js` - Updated to handle both trek and banner section types with proper validation
  - `frontend/src/components/TrekSectionManager.js` - Enhanced with type selector and conditional form fields for banner configuration
  - `frontend/src/components/TrekBannerSection.js` - New component for displaying banner sections with mobile-responsive design
  - `frontend/src/components/HomeTrekSections.js` - Updated to render both trek sections and banner sections based on type
- **Features Added**:
  - Type selector (Trek Section vs Banner Section) in the admin interface
  - Banner image upload with overlay text and color customization
  - Coupon code and discount percentage support
  - Mobile optimization toggle
  - Link to specific trek detail pages
  - Unified ordering system for mixed content
