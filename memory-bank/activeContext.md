# Active Context

**Current Focus:** Initial project setup and understanding. The immediate task was to analyze the existing codebase (@Codebase) to populate the Memory Bank files.

**Recent Changes:**

*   Created initial versions of all core Memory Bank files based on codebase analysis.

**Next Steps:**

1.  Await further instructions or specific tasks from the user.
2.  Potentially refine the Memory Bank files if more context or specific requirements are provided.
3.  Address any specific areas identified during the initial analysis (e.g., clarifying relationships between image fields in the `Trek` model, reviewing complex form state management).

**Active Decisions/Considerations:**

*   The analysis assumes the codebase provided represents the current state of the project.
*   Features like promo codes, offers, support tickets, and detailed file upload handling are inferred from routes/controllers/models but their full implementation details require further investigation if they become the focus.
