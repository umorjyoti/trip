# Active Context

## Current Focus: Partial Payment Feature Implementation

### Recent Changes (Latest Session)

#### 1. Fixed Trek Update Issue
- **Problem**: Partial payment settings were not being saved when editing a trek
- **Solution**: Updated `backend/controllers/trekController.js` to extract and handle `partialPayment` field in the `updateTrek` function
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `backend/controllers/trekController.js` - Added `partialPayment` to destructured fields and `updateData` object

#### 2. Fixed Route Conflict Issue
- **Problem**: `/check-pending` route was being caught by `/:id` route, causing "Cast to ObjectId failed" error
- **Solution**: Moved `/check-pending` route before `/:id` route in `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Reordered routes to fix conflict

#### 3. Added Delete Pending Booking Feature
- **Problem**: Users with existing pending payments had no way to delete them and start fresh
- **Solution**: Implemented complete delete pending booking functionality
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Added `deletePendingBooking` function
  - `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Added `DELETE /pending/:bookingId` route
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added `deletePendingBooking` API function
  - `frontend/src/pages/BookingPage.js` - Added modal with options to continue or delete existing booking

#### 4. Added Partial Payment Actions for Admin
- **Problem**: Admin booking tables and trek performance pages didn't show specific actions for partial payment bookings
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive partial payment management actions for admins
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Added `sendPartialPaymentReminder` and `markPartialPaymentComplete` functions
  - `backend/routes/bookingRoutes.js` - Added routes for partial payment actions
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added API functions for partial payment actions
  - `frontend/src/components/BookingActionMenu.js` - Added partial payment actions to dropdown menu
  - `frontend/src/pages/AdminBookings.js` - Added handlers for partial payment actions
  - `frontend/src/pages/TrekPerformance.js` - Added handlers for partial payment actions

#### 5. Enhanced Invoice Generation for Partial Payments
- **Problem**: Invoices didn't reflect partial payment status and payment breakdown
- **Solution**: Updated invoice generator to include comprehensive partial payment information
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/utils/invoiceGenerator.js` - Enhanced to show partial payment breakdown, remaining balance, due dates, and payment status

#### 6. Fixed Revenue Calculation and Display for Partial Payments
- **Problem**: Revenue was calculated using total booking amount instead of actual amount paid for partial payments
- **Solution**: Updated revenue calculation and display to show correct amounts for partial payments
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/controllers/trekController.js` - Updated `getBatchPerformance` and `getTrekPerformance` to calculate revenue based on actual amount paid for partial payments
  - `frontend/src/pages/TrekPerformance.js` - Updated booking table to show amount paid, remaining balance, and due dates for partial payments
  - `frontend/src/components/ViewBookingModal.js` - Enhanced to show comprehensive partial payment information including payment mode, initial payment, remaining balance, and due dates
  - `frontend/src/services/api.js` - Added cache-busting to `getBatchPerformance` and `getTrekPerformance` API calls to ensure fresh data

#### 7. Enhanced Booking Details Page for Partial Payments
- **Problem**: Booking details page didn't show partial payment information like remaining balance and due date
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive partial payment information display in the booking details page
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/src/pages/BookingDetail.js` - Added partial payment section showing payment mode, amount paid, remaining balance, due date, and final payment date
  - Added prominent Payment Summary section with large display of remaining due amount and "Pay Remaining Balance" button
  - `backend/controllers/bookingController.js` - Fixed `getBookingById` to include `paymentMode` and `partialPaymentDetails` fields in response

### Current Status

âœ… **Completed Features:**

- Partial payment selection in booking form
- Payment processing for partial payments
- Remaining balance payment functionality

ðŸ”„ **Ready for Testing:**
- End-to-end partial payment flow
- Trek editing with partial payment settings
- Pending booking management (check, continue, delete)
- Reminder system for due payments

### Next Steps

1. **Test the complete flow**:
   - Create/edit trek with partial payment settings
   - Make booking with partial payment
   - Test remaining balance payment
   - Test pending booking deletion

2. **Set up cron jobs** for reminder system:
   - Configure automated reminders for due partial payments

3. **Update documentation**:

### Technical Notes

- **Route Order**: Specific routes must come before parameterized routes in Express.js
- **Partial Payment Validation**: Only works for non-group bookings and when enabled per trek
- **Pending Booking Management**: Users can now check, continue, or delete existing pending bookings
- **Security**: Delete pending booking only works for the booking owner and only for pending_payment status
