# Product Context: Bengaluru Trekkers

**Problem Solved:** Planning and booking trekking trips can be fragmented and time-consuming. Users need a centralized platform to discover treks, get reliable information, compare options, and book securely. Trek operators need an efficient system to manage their offerings, schedules (batches), bookings, and customer data.

**Target Audience:**

*   **End Users:** Adventure enthusiasts, hikers, travelers looking for organized trekking experiences.
*   **Administrators:** Trekking company staff responsible for managing trek offerings, bookings, customer interactions, and business performance.

**How it Should Work (User Flow):**

1.  **Discovery:** Users visit the site, browse treks via lists, search, filters (region, difficulty, etc.), or dedicated sections (e.g., Weekend Getaways).
2.  **Exploration:** Users view trek details (description, itinerary, photos, price, available dates/batches, inclusions/exclusions, packing lists, FAQs).
3.  **Booking:** Users select a specific batch, provide participant details and contact information, and confirm the booking.
4.  **Post-Booking:** Users can view their booking details in their profile.
5.  **Profile Management:** Users can update their profile information and manage their wishlist.

**How it Should Work (Admin Flow):**

1.  **Login:** Admins log in to a separate dashboard area.
2.  **Overview:** Admins view key statistics on the dashboard (sales, bookings, etc.).
3.  **Trek Management:** Admins create, update, or delete trek details, including adding/removing batches, defining itineraries, setting prices, uploading images, and controlling trek visibility (enabled/disabled).
4.  **Region Management:** Admins manage geographical regions where treks are offered.
5.  **Booking Management:** Admins view all bookings, potentially update status or details.
6.  **User Management:** Admins view and manage user accounts.
7.  **Reporting:** Admins access sales reports and statistics, filtering by time range.
8.  **Other Management:** Admins manage leads, support tickets, promo codes, offers, and site content sections.

**User Experience Goals:**

*   **Intuitive Navigation:** Easy for users to find treks and information.
