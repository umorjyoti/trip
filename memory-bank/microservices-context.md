# Microservices Migration Context

## Project Overview
- **Goal**: Migrate monolithic backend to microservices architecture without changing existing backend folder
- **Current Status**: Working on Trek Service implementation (Task 3.1 in progress)

## Completed Work

### 1. Shared Utilities Package
- Database connection utilities
- Error handling middleware
- Validation utilities
- Authentication middleware
- Logging system
- Environment configuration

### 2. User Service (Complete)
- **Models**: User and UserGroup with comprehensive schemas
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, OTP verification, Google OAuth
- **Controllers**: Registration, login, profile management, admin functions
- **Routes**: Auth, profile, user management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests

### 3. Trek Service (In Progress - Task 3.1)
- **Models Created**: Trek, Region, TrekSection with full schemas
- **Server**: Express server with middleware setup
- **Controllers**: Started Trek controller with CRUD operations
- **Status**: Currently implementing Trek Service structure and models

## Architecture Decisions
- Each service has its own database collections
- Shared utilities package for common functionality
- Docker Compose for orchestration
- JWT-based authentication
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Services Structure
1. **User Service** (‚úÖ Complete)
2. **Trek Service** (üîÑ In Progress)
3. **Batch Service** (‚è≥ Pending)
4. **Booking Service** (‚è≥ Pending)

9. **Gateway Service** (‚è≥ Pending)

## Current Task
**Task 3.1**: Create Trek Service structure and models
- ‚úÖ Trek model with comprehensive schema
- ‚úÖ Region model for geographic organization
- ‚úÖ TrekSection model for detailed route information
- ‚úÖ Models index file
- ‚úÖ Express server setup
- üîÑ Currently working on Trek controller implementation

## Next Steps
- Complete Trek controller
- Implement Region and TrekSection controllers
- Create routes for Trek Service
- Add comprehensive testing
- Move to next service implementation
