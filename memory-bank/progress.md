# Progress

**What Works (Inferred from Code):**

*   **Core CRUD:**
    *   Treks: Creation, Reading (list/detail), Updating, Deleting (implied), Enabling/Disabling.
    *   Regions: Creation, Reading, Updating (implied by `RegionManager`).
    *   Users: Registration, Login, Profile viewing (implied), Admin viewing/management.
    *   Bookings: Creation, Reading (user's bookings, all bookings for admin), Cancellation (implied by status).
    *   Batches: Adding/Removing batches via `TrekForm` and `BatchManager`.
    *   Itinerary: Adding/Removing days/activities via `TrekForm`.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** User login/registration, JWT handling, Admin route protection.
*   **Frontend UI:** Basic layout, trek listing/details, booking form, admin dashboard structure, various components for displaying data and forms.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Overview stats, lists for treks/bookings/users, forms for editing treks, region management UI.
*   **Sales Statistics:** Backend endpoint (`/stats/sales`) calculates revenue, booking counts, averages, grouped by region/period, and top treks based on time range. Frontend dashboard displays some of these stats.
*   **Wishlist:** Add/remove functionality and viewing user's wishlist.
*   **Weekend Getaways:** Specific fields in `Trek` model and potentially specialized display logic.

**What's Left to Build / Refine:**

*   **Untested Features:** Full implementation and testing of Promo Codes, Offers, Support Tickets, Leads management.
*   **File Uploads:** While `multer` is present, the full workflow (upload UI, storage, linking URLs to models) isn't fully clear. The various image fields in `Trek` model (`images`, `gallery`, `partyImages`, etc.) need clear usage patterns.
*   **Complex Form Refinement:** `TrekForm` manages a lot of state; could benefit from refactoring or state management improvements for maintainability.
*   **Frontend State Management:** For larger-scale data sharing beyond auth, consider a dedicated library (Redux, Zustand) or more extensive use of Context.
*   **Error Handling:** Robustness check - ensure consistent error handling and user feedback across frontend and backend.
*   **Testing:** Expand backend test coverage (especially for controllers beyond `bookingController`). Implement frontend testing (unit, integration, e2e).
*   **UI/UX Polish:** Refine animations, loading states, responsiveness, and overall user experience based on testing and feedback.
*   **Deployment:** Setup deployment pipelines and configurations for frontend and backend.
*   **Weekend Getaway UI:** Ensure dedicated UI components effectively display the extra fields associated with Weekend Getaways.
*   **Region Detail Page:** Enhance `RegionDetail` page to utilize all fields from the `Region` model (descriptions, images, videos, related regions).

**Current Status:**

*   The core functionality for browsing treks, booking, user management, and admin oversight seems to be in place.
*   The application structure is established (MERN stack, REST API).
*   Several advanced features are modeled in the backend but may require further frontend implementation and refinement.

**Known Issues (Potential):**

*   Potential for redundant data fetching in some frontend components (e.g., `TrekCard` fetching region).
*   Complexity in managing nested state within `TrekForm`.
*   Clarity needed on the purpose and usage of multiple image array fields in the `Trek` model.
