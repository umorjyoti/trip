# Notification System Test Guide

## Overview
This guide helps you test the in-app notification system for the admin side. The system creates notifications for the following events:

1. **Booking Confirmed with Payment** - When a booking payment is confirmed
2. **Lead Created** - When a new lead is submitted
3. **Support Ticket Created** - When a user creates a support ticket
4. **Cancellation Request** - When a user requests booking cancellation
5. **Reschedule Request** - When a user requests booking reschedule

## Backend Setup Verification

### 1. Check Database Connection
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Verify the Notification model is properly indexed

### 2. Test API Endpoints
Use the following curl commands or Postman to test the notification APIs:

#### Get Notifications
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/notifications" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Get Unread Count
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/notifications/unread-count" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Mark as Read
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5000/api/notifications/NOTIFICATION_ID/read" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Mark All as Read
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5000/api/notifications/mark-all-read" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Integration Testing

### 1. Complete User Journey

5. Admin navigates to booking details
6. Admin processes the booking

### 2. Multiple Events
- Create multiple different types of notifications
- Verify all appear correctly
- Test filtering and sorting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Notifications not appearing**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify backend server is running
   - Check database connection
   - Verify admin user permissions

2. **Unread count not updating**
   - Check network requests in browser dev tools
   - Verify API responses
   - Check notification context state

3. **Real-time updates not working**
   - Verify polling interval (30 seconds)
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify user is logged in as admin

4. **Styling issues**
