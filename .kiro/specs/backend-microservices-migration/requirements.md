# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing monolithic backend architecture to a microservices architecture. The goal is to decompose the current single backend application into multiple, independently deployable services that communicate through well-defined APIs. Each microservice will be responsible for a specific business domain, enabling better scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy. The migration will create new microservices in the `microservices` folder while preserving the existing backend as a reference.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want to decompose the monolithic backend into domain-specific microservices, so that each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the microservices are created THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing API functionality
2. WHEN a microservice is deployed THEN it SHALL be independently deployable without affecting other services
3. WHEN the migration is complete THEN each microservice SHALL handle only its specific business domain
4. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use well-defined REST APIs or message queues
5. IF a service fails THEN other services SHALL continue to operate independently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each microservice to have its own database and data models, so that services are loosely coupled and can evolve independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a microservice is created THEN it SHALL have its own dedicated database schema or database instance
2. WHEN data is needed from another service THEN it SHALL be accessed through API calls, not direct database access
3. WHEN a service updates its data model THEN it SHALL not break other services
4. WHEN services share data THEN they SHALL use event-driven patterns or API contracts
5. IF database migration is needed THEN each service SHALL manage its own database migrations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want each microservice to have its own configuration and environment setup, so that services can be configured and deployed independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a microservice is created THEN it SHALL have its own package.json and dependencies
2. WHEN environment variables are needed THEN each service SHALL have its own .env configuration
3. WHEN a service is deployed THEN it SHALL have its own Docker configuration
4. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL be able to run on different ports
5. IF configuration changes THEN only the affected service SHALL need to be redeployed

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want clear service boundaries based on business domains, so that code organization follows domain-driven design principles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are defined THEN they SHALL be organized by business capability (auth, booking, trek, payment, etc.)
2. WHEN a feature spans multiple domains THEN services SHALL communicate through well-defined interfaces
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL reside in the appropriate domain service
4. WHEN cross-cutting concerns exist THEN they SHALL be handled through shared libraries or gateway patterns
5. IF domain boundaries change THEN services SHALL be refactored to maintain clear separation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper service discovery and communication patterns, so that services can find and communicate with each other reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services need to communicate THEN they SHALL use HTTP REST APIs as the primary communication method
2. WHEN service endpoints change THEN they SHALL maintain backward compatibility or use versioning
3. WHEN a service is unavailable THEN calling services SHALL handle failures gracefully
4. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL register their availability and health status
5. IF network issues occur THEN services SHALL implement retry and circuit breaker patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want each microservice to have comprehensive testing, so that services can be tested and validated independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a microservice is created THEN it SHALL have unit tests for its business logic
2. WHEN services interact THEN they SHALL have integration tests for API contracts
3. WHEN the system is tested THEN each service SHALL have its own test suite
4. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL be able to execute independently for each service
5. IF a service changes THEN its tests SHALL validate the changes without requiring full system testing

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the migration to maintain all existing functionality, so that users experience no disruption during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the microservices are deployed THEN all existing API endpoints SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN user requests are made THEN they SHALL receive the same responses as before migration
3. WHEN data is accessed THEN it SHALL maintain consistency across service boundaries
4. WHEN the system processes requests THEN performance SHALL be maintained or improved
5. IF issues arise THEN there SHALL be a rollback strategy to the monolithic version
